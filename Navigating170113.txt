Navigating the Jungle of R Packages

The R ecosystem has many packages in various collections, 
especially CRAN, Bioconductor, and GitHub. While this 
richness of choice speaks to the popularity and
importance of R, the large number of contributed packages 
makes it difficult for users to find appropriate tools for
their work.

A session on this subject has been approved for UseR! in 
Brussels. The tentative structure is three short 
introductory presentations, followed by discussion or 
planning work to improve the tools available to help 
users find the best R package and function for their needs. 

The currently proposed topics are

- wrapper packages that allow diverse tools that perform 
  similar functions to be accessed by unified calls

- collaborative mechanisms to create and update Task Views

- search and sort tools to find packages.

At the time of writing we have tentative presenters for 
the topics, but welcome others. We hope these presentations 
at useR! 2017 will be part of a larger discussion that will 
contribute to an increased team effort after the conference 
to improve the the support for R users in these areas.
