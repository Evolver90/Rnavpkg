There will be a special session Wed. July 5, from 17:00 - 18:30 in the main meeting room to 
provide for discussion and hopefully team-building for the development of tools to improve
the ability of users to quickly find and efficiently exploit the richness of the **R** package collections. Following brief presentations, we hope to gather in smaller groups to address
such approaches as wrappers to unify package calls, improved task views and similar aids to
guide package selection, and better search methods. Other ideas are welcome. Advance materials
are available in the wiki at https://github.com/nashjc/Rnavpkg/wiki and in the "package" 
https://github.com/nashjc/Rnavpkg. We welcome advance communications with interested use**R**s.
