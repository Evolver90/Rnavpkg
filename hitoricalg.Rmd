# 1-page summary

Many (most?) of the algorithms making up the numerical building-blocks of scientific software today
were developed and rendered into published code in the decade and a half between 1965 and 1980.
Codes were mostly in Fortran, with some in Algol and BASIC. Slightly after this period, some 
were published in Pascal. Today the proportion of workers in scientific and statistical 
computation who are fluent with these
computer languages is few, and the original authors are retired or deceased. 

Unfortunately, there may be deficiencies in the codes. In my own fields of work as it applies 
to the R Project for Statistical Computing, the provenance of the optim::L-BFGS-B and the 
nlm functions are unclear, and nlm() has recently been shown by Maria Boehmer to be buggy.
Even if there are no outright bugs, there may be incomplete code sections (i.e., features
mentioned but not fully implemented) or there may be programming constructs that were used
to exploit or work around particular hardware and operating system constraints. 

Many older algorithms were left by the wayside as they were found to be non-performant or
awkward to use as computer power became more readily available. However, new computing
platforms, such as quantum computers, may be able to better use some of these discarded
methods. 

To avoid the potential loss of algorithmic knowledge, I have started to code some algorithms
which I have used and/or developed into plain R code. R is suitably high level for describing
algorithms clearly but succinctly in most cases. However, the features of Rmarkdown and the 
knitr processor -- including its ability to have Fortran and other language chunks -- makes
R a good vehicle for presenting and documenting old codes. 

While some greybeards like myself can do much by reimplementing old algorithms, the process of
reimplementing algorithms, documenting, checking and comparing their results would gain a lot
more value if done in partnership with young workers. The latter would be exposed to the older
programming languages as well as the algorithms, and personal interaction with people who were
participants in work using those methods could amplify the knowledge transfer.

The rest of this document adds some detail to the general proposal.
