# Rnavpkg

This repository holds materials related to the UseR! 2017 session

           Navigating the R package universe

to be held Wed. July 5, from 17:00 - 18:30 in the main meeting room.
While we will present a few ideas, our aim is to promote ongoing activity 
that will assist users to find and use R packages efficiently, that is,
to navigate through the thousands of packages.

The main wiki page includes links to the important material. See

Organizers: John Nash, Julia Silge, and Spencer Graves
