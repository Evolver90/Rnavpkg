## Background

Jungles -- rain forests -- are places rich in resources. 
    
    - more than 10000 packages in CRAN
    - many vignettes and Blogs
    - more stuff in Bioconductor, Github and other collections


Resources are often difficult to find

Forest is usually hard to navigate

## Some responses to the challenge

**Wrappers** -- packages that unify the call to a number of resources for a common set of tasks

**Task Views** -- Guides to resources and how their development, timeliness and accessibility can be improved

**Search** -- improving how users can find the tools they need and information on how to use them effectively and efficiently
