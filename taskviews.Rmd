# GOOD NEWS & BAD NEWS

## What this means for R users {.grid}

- There are many resources out there for many differents kinds of tasks
- It can be difficult to find what you are looking for
- Assessing quality can be a challenge

## What this means for package developers {.grid}

- Most R users are open to trying out new packages
- There are so many packages that it can be difficult to connect with *your* audience

## What is a CRAN Task View?

Let's [check out the Task Views right now](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/)

## The `ctv` package

```{r}
library(ctv)

available.views(repos = "https://cran.rstudio.com/")
```

## The `ctv` package

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.views("NaturalLanguageProcessing")

install.views("NaturalLanguageProcessing", coreOnly = TRUE)
```


## Task Views, the UNOFFICIAL VERSIONS

- Sometimes package developers and users put together Task Views on their own
- Check out Ben Marwick's [archaeology CTV](https://github.com/benmarwick/ctv-archaeology) or Thomas Leeper's [open data CTV](https://github.com/ropensci/opendata)

## What this means for Task View maintainers {.grid}

- Making (and keeping!) a Task View useful can be a challenge
- Task Views vary in how helpful and up-to-date they are
- Could more CTVs move to being maintined on GitHub?

## Two possible approaches for CTVs + GitHub

- [Editing a markdown file and using makefiles to get to XML](https://github.com/ropensci/webservices)
- [Editing XML and using a pretty simple script to get to markdown](https://github.com/eddelbuettel/ctv-finance)
